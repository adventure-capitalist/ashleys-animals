      We strive to help rehome smaller animals



      that might be turned away by traditional animal shelters.

      In the words of Walt Disney: "it all started with a mouse." Ashley

      started helping small animals in need in 2013 and since then, every

      year she has helped around 50 small animals find their forever homes.

      We regularly take in all kinds of small animals. We specialise in

      small mammals such as mice, rats, hamsters and guinea pigs, however, we

      have also helped plenty of reptiles over the years.

      We aim to keep the adoption process as straight forward and simple as

      possible. Our adoptive families will just need to prove that they can

      provide high quality care to our animals, and that they are

      knowledgable about the individual needs of each species. We will help

      to educate wherever possible.
